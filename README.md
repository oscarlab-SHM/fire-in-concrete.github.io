Data provided here is in the form of excel sheet, which is consisting of 5 sheets.
Each sheet contains data for individual result parameter as shown in Table 3. 
These result parameters are recorded for each case for plain and reinforced concrete separately. 
Sheet 1	-Thermal Conductivity (W/m℃),
Sheet 2	-Displacement (mm),
Sheet 3	-Crack Width (mm),
Sheet 4	-Maximum Stress (MPa),and
Sheet 5	-Maximum Strain.
Data is represented in excel sheet separately for PCC and RCC for result parameter at different maximum temperature against the selected grade of concrete. 
Example-
if displacement data is explained, where displacement in plain cement concrete for M35 at 750℃ is 0.165mm which is marked as PC-M35@750℃ .
For reinforced cement concrete displacement for M45 at 250℃ is 0.115mm, and it is marked as RC-M45@250℃. 
Similarly, results in other data sheet can be read and understood for both plain and reinforced concrete beam.
